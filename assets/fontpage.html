			<h2>Ween is a band that has at least one song that you will love...</h2>
				<p>
					...This truth is made possible by Ween's wiley resistance to being catagorized, coupled with a tenacity and longevity that has allowed them to be prolific in creating unique soundscapes that differ drastically between songs and albums. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Basically, they have so many songs that cover so many styles of music, if you listen long enough, you will find a song you will absolutly love...

			<h2>Ween's fanbase is devoted.</h2>
				<p>
					It is always supprising to me how committed Weens fans are. They make costumes and fan videos and travel from far and wide to see their favorite band. I think it is because of how much fun they have creating music. It is clear to me that Ween dosn't take anything too seriously and instead they focus on being unique and entertaining.

			<h2>In May of 2012 Ween broke up!</h2>
				<p>
					Gene was tired and needed to stop living such a distructive lifestyle. In the following 4 years, distraught fans made tributes and begged them to have a reunion. 
				<p>
					In Feburary of 2016 they obliged by holding a three night rock-a-thon at the Broomfield Event Center in Broomfield Colorado. They sold out the venue in minutes and the shows success prompted them to get back to gether for good, and they have been touring again ever since.
